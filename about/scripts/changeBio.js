His artistic eye compelled him to use several custom armor-stand creations (such as arcade machines, a ping-pong table, lawn chairs, etc.), and over 5 double chests of decorative custom player heads. At the suggestion of ThreeMonkeys, he created 6 custom terrain maps using WorldPainter that added to the immersion of the maps. SBMteam was instrumental in creating the images for over 960 custom map art files that display the Settings UI (User Interface, the visual representation of menus, sidebars, buttons, etc. in a game), Mobfall Museum artwork, and new block textures that enhance builds.'+

He also used the site minecraft.tools to generate interactive clickable books that execute code, initiate teleports, and more. Most notably, he programmed a Python script that automatically generated over 5200 advancement JSON files and mcfunction files that automatically reset trapdoors, chests, double chests, and doors in the Lobby and other stages; this prevents players (even in Adventure Mode) from interacting with certain blocks and restores items in chests hidden throughout The Lobby.'+

In addition to squashing many bugs, he designed and implemented many of the main features in the game, including the logic for the shop, death/respawn, music & sound effects, weapon & armor balancing, special arrows & weapons, mob spawning, special mob behavior & effects, leaderboard system, settings, interactive tutorial world, scorekeeping, timers, and much more.

This impulsive, ad-hoc style of development extended the development timeline by more than a year over the course of the project, which created a classic software development problem known as "feature creep." But feature creep itself is a feature, not a bug! Under the direction of ThreeMonkeys, Team Mobfall wrote a custom soundtrack for the game that was released as an album, made custom terrain with WorldPainter, designed and implemented complex user interfaces (UI is the visual representation of menus, sidebars, buttons, etc. in a game.), and designed a comprehensive tutorial.'+
